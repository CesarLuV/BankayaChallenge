1. What are the supported data types in Python?
In Python exists the followind data types:
- Numeric types, that includes:
  + int
  + float
  + complex numbers
- Sequence types, that includes:
  + String
  + List
  + Tuples
- Dictionary
- Set
- Boolean

2. What is the difference between tuples and lists in Python?
There are several differences like:
- Tuples are faster than lists.
- Lists have several built-in functions while tuples do not have.
- Lists are mutable (can add or remove elements), in the other hand Tuples are inmutable (can't be edited).
- Lists consume more memory compared to tuples.

3. What are Python decorators?
A decorator allows a function to change it's behaviour, this is achieved by extending it's functionality without explicity modifiying the function.

4. What are generators in Python?
A generator is a specialized code snippet capable of produce a set of values to control the iteration process. For example the range(n) python function.

5. What are shallow and deep copy operations?
A shallow copy consists on assign the same reference of an object to another variable.
A deep copy generates a new reference in memory to store the same elements of i.e., a list.
Doing a shallow copy like the following example:
list1 = [1,2,3]
list2 = list1
list2[0] = 4

The change done in the second list will be visible in both lists.

6. Explain Dependency Injection?
This is a technique where an object receives other objects that it depends on. This simplifies to extend the existing code and it's maintenance.
For example, in Python we can pass objects or functions as parameters. 
This technique helps on manage the complexity of the code and provides an easier way to extend the application.

7. Explain how you can make a Python Script executable on Unix?
For explicity Unix based systems, in the Python scripts, the first line should be:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
This specifies the OS to search for the Python interpreter in the whole PATH.
